# Fastup

A production-ready FastAPI starter with solid architecture and essential dev tools.

## What's Inside

- **Domain-Driven Design**: Clean separation of concerns with domain, application, infrastructure, and presentation layers
- **CQRS Pattern**: Message bus, repository pattern, and unit of work for scalable command/query handling
- **Async Everything**: SQLAlchemy with asyncpg for fully asynchronous operations
- **Dev Ready**: Pre-configured formatters, linters, and Alembic for migrations

## Purpose

This isn't just a quick-start template. It's an opinionated foundation with architectural patterns and tooling that scales from day one.
